# electron-gtk-theme

This module inspects the system GTK theme, icon theme, and builds browser-compatible CSS. It is based on [postcss-gtk](https://github.com/1j01/postcss-gtk) and [@jakejarrett/gtk-theme](https://github.com/jakejarrett/node-gtk-theme). This is alpha-quality software and a work-in-progress.
